Stored Procedure : create stored procedure to calculate fine of students. Consider Tables: 
1. Borrower(Roll_no, Name, DateofIssue, NameofBook, Status) 
2. Fine(Roll_no,Date,Amt) 
∙ Accept Roll_no and Name of Book from user. 
∙ Check the number of days (from date of issue). 
∙ If days are between 15 to 30 then fine amount will be Rs 5per day. 
∙ If no. of days>30, per day fine will be Rs 50 per day and for days less than 30, Rs. 5per  day. 
∙ After submitting the book, status will change from I to R. 
∙ If condition of fine is true, then details will be stored into fine table. 
∙ Also handles the exception by named exception handler
